# Challenge 1- Word Challenges

# Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the palindromes from the original list, in the same order.


def palindrome(input):
    """
    This function takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing only the palindromes from the original list.
    
    :param input: List of strings
    :return: List of palindromes
    """
    return [word for word in input if word == word[::-1]]

# Example usage
print(palindrome(["radar", "hello", "level", "world", "noon"]))




# Now we will modify the function so that it returns the reverse of all words, irrespective of whether they are palindromes or not.

def reverse_words(input):
    """
    This function takes a list of strings and returns a new list containing the reverse of each word from the original list.
    
    :param input: List of strings
    :return: List of reversed words
    """
    return [word[::-1] for word in input]


# Now we will test this with a bunch of test words...by using the original list of words that I searched only for palindroms
