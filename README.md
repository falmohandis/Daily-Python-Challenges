## About

This project is a collection of daily Python challenges designed for middle school students. The goal is to help students build problem-solving skills and deepen their understanding of Python through hands-on practice. Each challenge comes with multiple solutions and explanations to encourage learning and exploration.

## File Naming Convention

Each challenge is saved as a separate file using the format:  
`DayX_ChallengeTopic.ipynb`  
For example: `Day1_StringManipulation.ipynb`  
This makes it easy to track progress and find specific topics.

## How to Use

1. Browse the repository and select a challenge file to work on.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Read the challenge description and attempt to solve it on your own.
4. Review the provided solutions and explanations to compare approaches.
5. Try modifying or extending the challenges for extra practice.

## Challenge List

- Day 1: String Manipulation (palindromes, reversing strings, etc.)
- Day 2: List Operations
- Day 3: Basic Loops and Conditionals
- Day 4: Functions and Arguments
- Day 5: Working with Dictionaries
- (More challenges will be added as the project grows.)

## Solution Approaches

For each challenge, youâ€™ll find:
- At least one straightforward solution.
- Alternative or more efficient solutions.
- Explanations comparing the pros and cons of each approach.
- Notes on common mistakes and tips for improvement.

## For Educators
